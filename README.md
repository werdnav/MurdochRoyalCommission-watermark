# Murdoch Royal Commission Watermark App
Android app used to apply a #MurdochRoyalCommission watermark to photos and videos. 

The intent of this app is to make it easy to apply a #MurdochRoyalCommission watermark to media content before uploading the content to social media (Reddit, Facebook, Twitter etc) and in doing so i) draw attention to the call for a [Murdoch Royal Comission](https://murdochroyalcommission.org.au/) into media monopolies and the impact on democracy and ii) prevent those same monopolies from publishing media content uploaded to social media without asking the author for permission to use the content.
